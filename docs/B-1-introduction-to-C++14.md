**What is C++14?**

On August 18, 2014, the [ISO (International Organization for Standardization)](https://www.iso.org/home.html) approved a new version of C++, called C++14. Unlike C++11, which added a huge amount of new functionality, C++14 is a comparatively minor update, mainly featuring bug fixes and small improvements.

**New improvements in C++14**

For your interest, here’s a list of the major improvements that C++14 adds. Note that this list is not comprehensive, but rather intended to highlight some of the key improvements of interest.

-   Aggregate member initialization ([10.5 -- Introduction to structs, members, and member selection](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-structs-members-and-member-selection/))
-   Binary literals ([4.15 -- Literals](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/literals/))
-   [[deprecated]] attribute (no tutorial yet)
-   Digit separators ([4.15 -- Literals](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/literals/))
-   Function return type deduction ([8.7 -- Type deduction for objects using the auto keyword](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/type-deduction-for-objects-using-the-auto-keyword/))
-   Generic lambdas ([12.7 -- Introduction to lambdas (anonymous functions)](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-lambdas-anonymous-functions/))
-   Relaxed constexpr functions ([6.14 -- Constexpr and consteval functions](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/constexpr-and-consteval-functions/))
